    "## Barplots and Pie Charts\n",
    "#Barplots and pie charts are commonly used to visualize **qualitative data by category frequency**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building a Barplot\n",
    "A barplot draws either vertical or horizontal bars, typically separated by white\n",
    "space, to visualize frequencies according to the relevant categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Barplot can also\n",
    "be used to visualize other quantities, such as means or proportions, which\n",
    "directly depend upon these frequencies.\n",
    "As an example, let's use the `mtcars` data set  Detailing various characteristics of 32 classic performance cars in\n",
    "the mid-1970s, the first five records can be viewed directly from the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "mtcars[1:5,]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation in `?mtcars` explains the variables that have been\n",
    "recorded. Of these, `cyl` provides the number of cylinders in each engine-\n",
    "four, six, or eight. To find out how many cars were observed with each number of cylinders, you can use table, as shown here:\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "cyl.freq <- table(mtcars$cyl)\n",
    "cyl.freq\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is easily displayed as a barplot, as shown here:\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "barplot(cyl.freq) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This plot displays the number of four-, six-, and eight-cylinder cars in the\n",
    "data set but is admittedly rather uninteresting, and without annotations it's\n",
    "not clear what's being summarized. Fortunately, it's easy to annotate such\n",
    "plots and further split up the frequencies of each bar according to an additional\n",
    "categorical variable. Consider the following code where, this time,\n",
    "you're finding the counts associated with `cyl` by transmission `(am)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "table(mtcars$cyl[mtcars$am==0])\n",
    "table(mtcars$cyl[mtcars$am==1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you aim to produce a barplot that's `stacked` (where bars are split up\n",
    "vertically) or `dodged` (where bars are broken up and placed beside each\n",
    "other), `barplot` requests its first argument as a suitably arranged matrix. You\n",
    "could construct it from the previous two vectors using matrix, but it's easier\n",
    "to just continue using `table`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "cyl.freq.matrix <- table(mtcars$am,mtcars$cyl)\n",
    "cyl.freq.matrix\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "barplot(cyl.freq.matrix,beside=TRUE,horiz=TRUE,las=1,\n",
    "main=\"Performance car counts\\nby transmission and cylinders\",\n",
    "names.arg=c(\"V4\",\"V6\",\"V8\"),legend.text=c(\"auto\",\"manual\"),\n",
    "args.legend=list(x=\"bottomright\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The help file `?barplot` explains the options here in detail. To label the\n",
    "bars according to the categories of the column variable of the matrix that\n",
    "was initially passed to barplot, you use a character vector of the appropriate\n",
    "length passed to `names.arg`. The options `beside=TRUE` and `horiz=TRUE` select a\n",
    "dodged, horizontal barplot. If both options were FALSE, a stacked, vertical\n",
    "barplot would be selected. The argument `las=1` forces the labels on the vertical\n",
    "axis to appear horizontally, rather than parallel to it. The final two arguments,\n",
    "`legend.text` and `args.legend`, are used for the legend.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar plots may be produced using `ggplot2`. If you load the installed\n",
    "package with `library(\"ggplot2\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "library(\"ggplot2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "qplot(factor(mtcars$cyl),geom=\"bar\")\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###A Quick Pie Chart\n",
    "\n",
    "The venerable `pie chart` is an alternative option for visualizing frequency-based\n",
    "quantities across levels of categorical variables, with appropriately\n",
    "sized \"slices\" representing the relative counts of each categorical variable.\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "pie(table(mtcars$cyl),labels=c(\"V4\",\"V6\",\"V8\"),\n",
    "col=c(\"white\",\"gray\",\"black\"),main=\"Performance cars by cylinders\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###Histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "The `barplot` is intuitively sensible for counting observations in relation to\n",
    "categorical variables but is of virtually no use if the variable you're interested\n",
    "in is numeric-continuous. To visualize the distribution of continuous measurements,\n",
    "you can use a `histogram`-a tool that's sometimes confused with\n",
    "a barplot owing to its similar appearance. A `histogram` also measures frequencies,\n",
    "but in targeting a numeric-continuous variable, it's first necessary\n",
    "to \"bin\" the observed data, meaning to define intervals and then count the\n",
    "number of continuous observations that fall within each one. The size of this\n",
    "interval is known as the `binwidth`.\n",
    "For a simple example of a `histogram`, consider the horsepower data of\n",
    "the 32 cars in `mtcars`, given in the fourth column, named `hp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "mtcars$hp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "hist(mtcars$hp)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of a histogram as a representation of the shape of a distribution\n",
    "of measurements depends solely upon the widths of the intervals\n",
    "used to bin the data. Binwidths are controlled in hist by the breaks argument.\n",
    "You can manually set these by supplying a vector, giving each breakpoint,\n",
    "to breaks. This is done in the following code by halving the width of\n",
    "each bin from 50 to 25 and widening the overall range somewhat, using an\n",
    "evenly spaced sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "hist(mtcars$hp,breaks=seq(0,400,25),col=\"gray\",main=\"Horsepower\",xlab=\"HP\")\n",
    "\n",
    "abline(v=c(mean(mtcars$hp),median(mtcars$hp)),lty=c(2,3),lwd=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "legend(\"topright\",legend=c(\"mean HP\",\"median HP\"),lty=c(2,3),lwd=2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, rather than defaulting to a data-driven algorithm such as hist,\n",
    "ggplot2 encourages users to become aware of the issue and actively set their\n",
    "own binwidths.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "qplot(mtcars$hp,geom=\"blank\",main=\"Horsepower\",xlab=\"HP\") +\n",
    "  geom_histogram(color=\"black\",fill=\"white\",breaks=seq(0,400,25), closed=\"right\") +\n",
    "  geom_vline(mapping=aes(xintercept=c(mean(mtcars$hp),median(mtcars$hp)), linetype=factor(c(\"mean\",\"median\"))),show.legend=TRUE) + \n",
    "  scale_linetype_manual(values=c(2,3)) +\n",
    "  labs(linetype=\"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###Box-and-Whisker Plots\n",
    "An especially popular alternative to the histogram is the box-and-whisker plot,\n",
    "or simply boxplot for short. This is merely a visual representation of the fivenumber\n",
    "summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to the built-in quakes data frame of the 1,000 seismic events near\n",
    "Fiji. For the sake of comparison, you can examine both a histogram and a\n",
    "boxplot of the magnitudes of these events using default base R behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "hist(quakes$mag)\n",
    "boxplot(quakes$mag)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the histogram, a boxplot shows important features of the distribution,\n",
    "such as global (in other words, overall) centrality, spread, and skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Side-by-Side Boxplots\n",
    "One particularly pleasing aspect of these plots is the ease with which you\n",
    "can compare the five-number summary distributions of different groups\n",
    "with side-by-side boxplots. Again using the quakes data, define the following\n",
    "corresponding factor and inspect the first five elements\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "stations.fac <- cut(quakes$stations,breaks=c(0,50,100,150))\n",
    "stations.fac[1:5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the stations variable records how many monitoring stations\n",
    "detected each event. This code has produced a factor breaking up these\n",
    "observations into one of three groups-events detected by 50 stations or\n",
    "fewer, between 51 and 100 stations, and between 101 and 150 stations. Thus,\n",
    "you can compare the distributions of the magnitudes of the events according\n",
    "to these three groups\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "boxplot(quakes$mag~stations.fac,\n",
    "xlab=\"# stations detected\",ylab=\"Magnitude\",col=\"gray\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning to ggplot2 functionality, qplot can produce the same type of plot\n",
    "easily,\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "qplot(stations.fac,quakes$mag,geom=\"boxplot\",\n",
    "xlab=\"# stations detected\",ylab=\"Magnitude\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###Scatterplots\n",
    "A scatterplot is most frequently used to identify a relationship between the\n",
    "observed values of two different numeric-continuous variables, displayed as\n",
    "x-y coordinate plots. The coordinate-wise nature of base R graphics lends\n",
    "itself naturally to the creation of scatterplots\n",
    "\n",
    "the famous iris data. Collected in the mid-\n",
    "1930s, this data frame of 150 rows and 5 columns consists of petal and sepal\n",
    "measurements for three species of perennial iris flowers-Iris setosa, Iris virginica,\n",
    "and Iris versicolor (Anderson, 1935; Fisher, 1936). You can view the\n",
    "first five records here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "iris[1:5,]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Plot\n",
    "You can modify a simple scatterplot to split the plotted points according to a\n",
    "categorical variable, exposing potential differences between any visible relationships\n",
    "with respect to the continuous variables. For example, using base\n",
    "R graphics, you can examine the petal measurements according to the three\n",
    "species.\n",
    "\n",
    "you can manually build up this plot by first using type=\"n\" to generate an\n",
    "empty plotting region of the correct dimensions and subsequently adding\n",
    "the points corresponding to each species, altering point character and color\n",
    "as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "plot(iris[,4],iris[,3],type=\"n\",xlab=\"Petal Width (cm)\",\n",
    "ylab=\"Petal Length (cm)\")\n",
    "\n",
    "points(iris[iris$Species==\"setosa\",4],\n",
    "iris[iris$Species==\"setosa\",3],pch=19,col=\"black\")\n",
    "points(iris[iris$Species==\"virginica\",4],\n",
    "iris[iris$Species==\"virginica\",3],pch=19,col=\"gray\")\n",
    "points(iris[iris$Species==\"versicolor\",4],\n",
    "iris[iris$Species==\"versicolor\",3],pch=1,col=\"black\")\n",
    "legend(\"topleft\",legend=c(\"setosa\",\"virginica\",\"versicolor\"),\n",
    "col=c(\"black\",\"gray\",\"black\"),pch=c(19,19,1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Iris virginica\n",
    "species has the largest petals, followed by Iris versicolor, and the smallest\n",
    "petals belong to Iris setosa. However, this code, while functional, is fairly\n",
    "cumbersome. You can generate the same image more simply by first setting\n",
    "up vectors that specify the desired point character and color for each individual\n",
    "observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Matrix of Plots\n",
    "The \"single\" type of planar scatterplot is really useful only when comparing\n",
    "two numeric-continuous variables. When there are more continuous variables\n",
    "of interest, it isn't possible to display this information satisfactorily on\n",
    "a single plot. A simple and common solution is to generate a two-variable\n",
    "scatterplot for each pair of variables and show them together in a structured\n",
    "way; this is referred to as a scatterplot matrix. Making use of the iris_pch and\n",
    "iris_col vectors created earlier, you can generate a scatterplot matrix for all\n",
    "four continuous variables in iris, retaining the distinction between species.\n",
    "Working with base R graphics, use the pairs function.\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "iris_pch <- rep(19,nrow(iris))\n",
    "iris_pch[iris$Species==\"versicolor\"] <- 1\n",
    "\n",
    "iris_col <- rep(\"black\",nrow(iris))\n",
    "iris_col[iris$Species==\"virginica\"] <- \"gray\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "pairs(iris[,1:4],pch=iris_pch,col=iris_col,cex=0.75)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "library(\"GGally\")\n",
    "\n",
    "ggpairs(iris,mapping=aes(col=Species),axisLabels=\"internal\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ggpairs offers an impressive visual array for such a short line of code.\n",
    "The output not only gives you the lower half of the scatterplot matrix produced\n",
    "with pairs but also provides equivalent histograms along the bottom\n",
    "and boxplots along the right. It also displays the estimates of the correlation\n",
    "coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Additinal examples of Basic graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following examples, you'll plot the outcome of a study investigating a new\n",
